## Getting Started
SanCasia Zero: Base implements the most commonly needed systems and components currently including a canvas based render system. If you are interested in the inner workings of this game engine or want to have a practical example of a ECS consider visiting [SanCasia Zero: Core](https://github.com/SanCasia/sancasia_zero-core).

If you want to understand how to develop basic games with the SanCasia game engine,  I recommend you read this article, as well as taking a look at the source code and associated test cases.

The source code of this series is located under `demo/getting_started/`.
